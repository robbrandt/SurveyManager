History
==================

Survey Manager was originally written by Benjamin Birney for v7x.  It was essentially useable in that form through Zikula v 1.2x.  It was used heavily in one site by the Botanical Society of America in that form.

To prepare for v 1.3, the BSA commissioned Guite to produce a complete rewrite using MOST 5.5 in early 2013.

With the release of MOST 6.x, it has been updated, lightly tested and released by the BSA.
